## Welcome to Mark Sternefeld's Website!

### Who am I?

My name is Mark Sternefeld. I grew up in a small town called Montague, New Jersey. I atteneded Pope John XXIII Regional Highschool and ran Track and Field. I enjoy hanging out with friends and seeking out new experiences. When I find the time, I go out and practice my skate tricks or just chillout longboarding.
