### Who am I?

My name is Mark Sternefeld. I grew up in a small town called Montague, New Jersey. I atteneded Pope John XXIII Regional Highschool and ran Track and Field. I enjoy hanging out with friends and seeking out new experiences. When I find the time, I go out and practice my skate tricks or just chillout longboarding.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Mster115/Mster115.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
